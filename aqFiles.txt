Practise they say makes perfect. For some of us, it is about time management. That is key. Very very key.

Just be focused. That is essential. Very very essential.

Against all odds. We will make something.

Again, it is better late than never. That is also very very very key


Loving this experience though. May Allaah overlook our shortcomings. Aameen.
